# Weekly Progress 3/6
## By Kyle Gavin 

For the last week we have been working on ideating on a UI Layout for out Chat App. With SwiftUI, It is a realativley simple process to get a basic structure up and running. The follow code snipped is a very basic sudo-code outline (That also happens to compile ðŸ˜‰). After the user authenticates, the ContentView brings users directly to a Left-Hand Side (LHS) Collumn which displays the identified users currently or previously on the local network. The Right-Hand Side (RHS) Collumn will display the selected Chat based on user input, and allow the user to send messages. 
```
struct ContentView: View {
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            listView()
            chatView()
        }
        .frame(maxWidth:650, maxHeight:350)
    
        
    }
}


struct listView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("This is the ListView")
       
    }
}
struct chatView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Selected Chat will Populate Here")
            
    }
}
```
SwiftUI features layout methods called Vertical Stack (VStack), Horizontal Stack (HStack), and Back-to-Front Stack (ZStack). Within each view structure usage of a VStack embedded with an HStack allows you to dynamically generate discovered users with a for loop.
```
struct listView: View {
    var body: some View {
    VStack() {
        For User : users {
        HStack() {
        Text(users.name)
        }
        .padding()
        }    
    }  
}
```
Similarly, you're albe to display chat messages, with send/recieved chats on the respective side using the .allignment methods. With these features combined I was able to complete a variety of sucessful test builds that display sudo data. 

Along with the utilities provided natievly with SwiftUI, we also decided to encorporate SF Symbols which is Apples native symbol library. This Library includes over 3000 symbols and shapes that will allows us to create a clean UI that matches the MacOS scheme. 


# Weekly Progress 2/24

Over the weekend I was researching topics regarding p2p networks, their structure, and identifying common strategies for implementation. Originally, I came up with the idea of a hybrid network for file transfer, messaging. etc. that relies on an addressing server to sync clients. While this allows clients to connect without explicitly entering each other's IP addresses, in the case of failure of the addressing system the program would still work properly. After doing a light mock-up test of this type of structure I realized that this wouldn't be feasible. Chat apps by nature are simpler as a client-server model because you send a message to a server and the server has a target user with a UUID. UUIDs are used to identify people uniquely as the possibility of two instances generating the same UUID is extremely low. Anyhow, a peer-to-peer network on LAN works better because this removes the need for a sync server. This ultimately makes the decision to stick to a LAN-based application more logical. With this LAN-based application, we will also be able to use similar protocols to implement a file share (if desired) along with chat.

For front-end development, I've spent some time as well working on a solution to make a lightweight visually appealing model. I suggested to the team a library called py2app which allows you to build macOS applications directly from python source code. I am more enthusiastic about doing a more conventional front-end design in swift or JavaScript. For the design, I'm thinking a sign-on page won't be necessary, rather than a load screen that goes directly into the selection of who you'd like to connect with. The cocoa API by Apple can be combined with py2app to design UI's using Xcodes system. 

# Problem Statement 
Users at Delaware State University need an alternative to GroupMe for class group chats. This is because GroupMe does not provide end-to-end encryption, therefore making it insecure.
